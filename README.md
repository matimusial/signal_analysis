# signal_analysis
The Python program simulates the transmission and reception of digital signals using various modulation schemes (ASK, PSK, FSK) and analyzes their performance in the presence of noise. The script generates 3D plots illustrating the impact of disturbances on the Bit Error Rate (BER) for different combinations of disturbance parameters.
